This is a front-end application the uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  jQuery dynamically updates the HTML of the application. Bootstrap provides responsiveness. 
Instructions:

Click on one of the four crystals. A specific number of points will be added to your total score.Win by matching the total score to the target number without busting.  
Values of the crystals will change after game restarts.
Match your points to the random number to win. If you go over, you lose!

Note: there are two version of the game because I am working on a multicrystal/image popout/and target score feature format that I won't have complete by due date.
